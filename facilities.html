      <p>A constructed wetland that receives treated wastewater from the municipality of Eskilstuna. The main purpose of the wetland is to reduce the nutrient content of the wastewater. Working with the group of Dr. Anders Wörman of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), we studied the variation of flow around vegetation in the wetland in order to understand how the wastewater discharge becomes distributed through the wetland. Solute transport dynamics in wetlands are extremely important for processes such as denitrification, and yet poorly understood. </a></p>
